# Linear Regression Model to Predict Package from CGPA

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts the package (e.g., salary) based on the CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) of students. The model uses a simple linear regression algorithm to establish a relationship between CGPA and the corresponding package.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles any missing or noisy data.
- **Linear Regression Model**: Implements a basic linear regression using `scikit-learn` to predict the package based on CGPA.
- **Visualization**: Provides a plot of CGPA vs. package, showing the regression line.

## Dataset
 The dataset consists of two columns:
- **CGPA**: A numerical column representing the CGPA of students.
- **Package**: A numerical column representing the salary/package offered.

Ensure your dataset is in CSV format and follows this structure:
